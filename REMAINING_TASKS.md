# Remaining Tasks for HW9 Submission

## ✅ COMPLETED

1. ✅ **Implementation** - All routes compliant with requirements
2. ✅ **Testing** - 77 backend tests, 12 frontend test files, 81%+ route coverage
3. ✅ **Test Report** - Comprehensive test documentation created

## ❌ STILL NEEDED

### 1. Implementation Status Report (IGS) - HIGH PRIORITY
**What:** Create/Update Implementation Grading Sheet
**Details:**
- Include "hw6 actual" and "hw7 actual" scores from your graded submissions
- Fill "hw9 claimed" column with cumulative points (including hw6 and hw7)
- Prefix new comments with "hw9:"
- Should show 100% implementation (84+ points)
**File:** Create `Full-Stack-Overflow-IGS.xlsx` or similar

### 2. AI Report - HIGH PRIORITY
**What:** Create/Update AI Report documenting AI tool usage
**Details:**
- If exists from hw7-code2, append hw9 experience
- If new, create cumulative report including hw9
- Document what AI tools you used (e.g., Cursor, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot)
- Describe how AI helped with implementation, testing, debugging
- File name: `Full-Stack-Overflow-AI-report.md` or `.txt`
- Optional: Create `Full-Stack-Overflow-AI-report-share.*` for sharing (can be anonymized)

### 3. Design Document - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**What:** Update Design Document
**Details:**
- Same structure as hw7-code2
- Update content as appropriate for hw9
- Include:
  - Architecture overview
  - Database schema
  - API design
  - System components
  - Data flow diagrams (if applicable)

### 4. Video - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**What:** Create/Update Video (omits Step 1, replaced by live demo)
**Content:**
- Step 2: Automated testing demonstration
  - Show running `npm test` in backend
  - Show coverage report
  - Demonstrate a few test cases
- Step 3: Code walkthrough
  - Walk through key route files
  - Explain date wrapper implementation
  - Show course catalog with prerequisites/SBCs
- Step 4: Architecture overview
  - System architecture
  - Database structure
  - API endpoints
- Step 5: Future work/discussion
  - What would you improve?
  - What features would you add?

### 5. Demo Preparation - LOW PRIORITY (can do closer to demo)
**What:** Prepare database and files for demo
**Details:**
- **Database setup:**
  - One or more team members as registrars
  - Scraped Fall 2025 course descriptions for: PSY, ECO, AMS, POL, ARH, CHE, CHI, EGL, HIS, PHI, PHY, SOC, SPN, WRT
  - Imported Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 class schedules for: PSY, ECO, AMS, POL
- **Files on server:**
  - `rooms1.yaml`
  - `graduation_requirements.yaml`
- **Hash file (if using option 2a):**
  - Create `Full-Stack-Overflow-hw9-hash.txt` with hash command and result
  - Use provided commands (Linux/macOS/Windows)

### 6. Submission Files - HIGH PRIORITY
**What:** Create submission zip
**Contents:**
- All implementation files
- Design document
- IGS (Implementation Grading Sheet)
- AI report
- Test reports (coverage) - ✅ Already have TEST_REPORT.md
- Video file or link
- Any other required documentation

**If using option 2a:**
- Upload `Full-Stack-Overflow-hw9-hash.txt` separately

## Priority Order

1. **IGS** - Required for grading
2. **AI Report** - Required for submission
3. **Submission Zip** - Final step before submission
4. **Design Document** - Important documentation
5. **Video** - Required for submission
6. **Demo Preparation** - Can be done closer to demo date

## Quick Start Guide

### To create IGS:
1. Get your hw6 and hw7 actual scores from graded submissions
2. Create spreadsheet with columns: Feature, hw6 actual, hw7 actual, hw9 claimed
3. Fill in cumulative points (hw6 + hw7 + hw9 new features)
4. Add comments prefixed with "hw9:"

### To create AI Report:
1. Create `Full-Stack-Overflow-AI-report.md`
2. Document:
   - What AI tools you used (Cursor, ChatGPT, etc.)
   - How AI helped with:
     - Route implementation
     - Test creation
     - Debugging
     - Code review
   - What you learned
   - Challenges faced

### To create Design Document:
1. Review your hw7-code2 design document (if exists)
2. Update with hw9 changes:
   - New routes added
   - Date wrapper utility
   - Enhanced course catalog features
   - Testing architecture

### To create Video:
1. Record screen showing:
   - Test execution (`cd server && npm test`)
   - Coverage report (`cd server && npm run coverage`)
   - Code walkthrough of key files
   - Architecture overview
2. Keep it under time limit (check assignment requirements)
3. Upload to YouTube or similar, include link in submission
